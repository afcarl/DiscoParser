    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This file contains documentation for Penn Discourse Treebank Version 2.0, Linguistic 
  Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2008T05 and isbn 1-58563-466-2. 
<p>The <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pdtb">Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB)</a> 
  Project, located at the <a href="http://www.ircs.upenn.edu/">Institute for Research 
  in Cognitive Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/">Univeristy of 
  Pennsylvania</a>, is funded by the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science 
  Foundation</a>, Grant No. EIA 02-24417. The goal of the project is to develop 
  a large scale corpus annotated with information related to discourse structure. 
  Penn Discourse Treebank Version 2.0 contains annotations of discourse relations 
  and their arguments on the one million word Wall Street Journal (WSJ) data in 
  <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC95T7">Treebank-2 
  (LDC95T7).</a></p>
<p>While there are many aspects of discourse that are crucial to a complete understanding 
  of natural language, the PDTB focuses on encoding discourse relations associated 
  with discourse connectives, adopting a lexically grounded approach for the annotation. 
  The corpus provides annotations for the argument structure of Explicit and Implicit 
  connectives, the senses of connectives and the attribution of connectives and 
  their arguments. The lexically grounded approach exposes a clearly defined level 
  of discourse structure which will support the extraction of a range of inferences 
  associated with discourse connectives.</p>
<p>To date, the PDTB group has carried out various experiments on the corpus, 
  particularly examining the following issues:
  
<UL>
  <LI> alignment between syntax and discourse, particularly with regards to attribution</LI>
  <LI>sense disambiguation of discourse connectives</LI>
  <LI>complexity of dependencies in discourse</LI>
</UL>

<p>The annotations in Penn Discourse Treebank Version 2.0 are linked to the <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/home.html">Penn 
  Treebank</a> .</p>

<p>The PDTB group will continue to explore these issues and to focus on more extended 
  projects such as discourse parsing, automatic summarization, and natural language 
  generation. Further work will also explore foundational issues in discourse.</p>
  


<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Following the approach towards discourse structure and discourse semantics 
  in D-LTAG, the PDTB annotates semantic or informational relations holding between 
  two (and only two) Abstract Objects (AOs), expressed either explicitly via lexical 
  items or implicitly via adjacency. For the former, the lexical items anchoring 
  the relation are annotated as Explicit connectives. For the latter, the implicit 
  inferrable relations are annotated by inserting an Implicit connective that 
  best expresses the inferred relation.</p>
<p>Explicit connectives are identified from three grammatical classes: subordinating 
  conjunctions (e.g., because, when), coordinating conjunctions (e.g., and, or), 
  and discourse adverbials (e.g., however, otherwise). Arguments of connectives 
  are simply labelled Arg2 for the argument appearing in the clause syntactically 
  bound to the connective, and Arg1 for the other argument. In the examples in 
  this section, Arg1 appears in italics while Arg2 appears in bold. In addition 
  to the argument structure of discourse relations, the PDTB also annotates the 
  attribution of relations (both explicit and implicit) as well as of each of 
  their arguments. A variety of cases can be distinguished depending on the attribution 
  source of the discourse relation or its arguments; i.e., whether the relation 
  or arguments are ascribed to the writer of the text or to someone other than 
  the writer.</p>
  
<p>The corpus annotates 40600 discourse relations, distributed into the following five types:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>18459 Explicit Relations</li>
		<li>16053 Implicit Relations</li>
		<li>624 Alternative Lexicalizations</li>
		<li>5210 Entity Relations</li>
		<li>254 No Relations</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This release includes a tool to convert the PDTB into a "pipe" delimited file suitable for loading into spreadsheets or manipulaton with scripts.  That tool may be found in the <a href="util">util</a> directory.</p>

<p>The Penn Discourse Treebank project provides a <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pdtb/PDTBAPI/">browser</a> 
  for exploring the Penn Discourse Treebank and the Prenn Treebank. In order to 
  use this software, users must also possess the Penn Treebank as it uses both 
  the raw Wall Street Journal text and the parse trees from that corpus. The project 
  also has extensive <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pdtb/PDTBAPI/docs/index.html">APIs</a> 
  for developing further applications for use with the Penn Discourse Treebank.</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>   

    <p>Additional information, updates, bug fixes may be available in the LDC
    catalog entry for this corpus at <a
    href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2008T05"
    style="text-decoration:none">LDC2008T05</a>.</p>
	<p>The developers of the Penn Discourse Treebank Version 2.0 
	<a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/catalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2008T05">LDC2008T05</a>
	have updated this release to add metadata to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) news
	stories in the corpus. The goal is to aid understanding PDTB files as texts and to
	support distinguishing texts from different genres within the WSJ. </p>

<p>The metadata includes of the following fields: Consult this 
<a href="./docs/meta-data-documentation.html">metadata documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li> DD: the date the article appeared in the WSJ 
<li>AN: unique identifier for the article 
<li>HL: the column name (for regular features such as Who's News, Marketing & Media, Technology), its headline and by-line 
<li>SO: the source of the article 
<li>IN: manually-assigned codes or keywords for the article 
<li>CO: manually-assigned codes for companies or other organizations 
<li>DATELINE: normally the location where the article was filed, but sometimes has very unexpected contents 
<li>GV: Branch of Government or Government Agency mentioned in the article 
<li>SBREAKS: the byte position of section breaks present in the file 
<li>ARTICLEBREAK: separates files that contain more than one article 
</ul>

<p>This update may be of value to discourse researchers. The meta-data can, for example, enable the texts to be distinguished by genre (news reports, editorials, etc.
[<a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/P/P09/Po9-1076.pdf">Webber, 2009</a>])
or by topic
[<a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/J/J11/J11-2004.pdf">Petrenz and Webber,
2011</a>]. These can then be used, for example, in text segmentation and
text summarization, or in testing hypotheses about domain adaptation
[<a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/P/P11/P11-1157.pdf">Plank and van
Noord, 2011</a>]. The data, on the other hand, can allow researchers to distinguish separate texts within a single file (e.g. the four separate letters to the editor in file wsj_0105) and thereby avoid, for example, attempting to produce one summary for the entire file. </p>
