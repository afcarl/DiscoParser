The convert.pl script converts a pdtb file into a pipe-delimited format.  Every relation is represented on a single line and values are delimited by the pipe symbol.  There are 48 columns per line.

The following lists the 48 column values.  For precise definitions of the terms used, please consult the accompanying annotation manual.  Certain values may be blank.  Please refer to the manual for full descriptions.
